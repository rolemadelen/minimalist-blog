# Note

Previously, people used `git filter-branch` to accomplish the same task. However, it shouldn't be used anymore, as it's [somewhat deprecated as of Git 2.24, Q4 2019](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25720268/git-commands-that-could-break-rewrite-the-history/58251653#58251653). Instead, we can now use `git filter-repo`.

## Installation

### brew

If you're using macOS, you can use Homebrew.

```shell
$ brew install git-filter-repo
```

After installation, you can use either `git filter-repo` or `git-filter-repo`.

### pip

Alternatively, you can use `pip` to install the package:

```shell
$ python3 -m pip install --user git-filter-repo
```

Once the installation is complete, if you can't use `git filter-repo` or `git-filter-repo`, check your PATH. Alternatively, you can use it as shown below:

```shell
$ <PATH TO PYTHON>/<VERSION>/bin/git-filter-repo
```

## mailmap

To use `git filter-repo`, you'll need to prepare a mailmap file, which is used to replace your old author names and emails with the new ones. The syntax for the mailmap file is as follows:

```text
Correct Name <correct@email.com> OLD NAME1 <old@email1.com>
Correct Name <correct@email.com> OLD NAME2 <old@email2.com>
```

Feel free to add as many `OLD NAME` and `OLD EMAIL` entries as necessary for multiple author names that need to be changed.

For example,

```text
Madelen Yoo <rolemadelen@tuta.io> John Doe <john@doe.com>
Madelen Yoo <rolemadelen@tuta.io> John Doe <johndoe@example.com>
Madelen Yoo <rolemadelen@tuta.io> Jane Doe <jane-doe@example.com>
```

## git filter-repo

Please note that you need a freshly cloned repository. If you are performing this on an existing repository, it's advisable to re-clone it.

```shell
$ cd repo

repo/$ git filter-repo --mailmap your-mailmap
```

After completing the task, the `origin` remote will be automatically removed. To restore it, you will need to add the `origin` back to your repository using the following command:

```shell
repo/$ git remote add origin REPO-URL
```
