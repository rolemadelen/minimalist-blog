# Note

There are _three_ major differences between a function declared with a `function` keyword and an arrow function.

1. An arrow function is not automatically hoisted; thus, it cannot be referenced until it is initialized.
2. An arrow function is more minimalistic, which is generally good for readability. Especially with [anonymous functions](./2402020528) or short functions that can be written in one line.
3. An arrow function can't be bound to `this`. It will inherit `this` from the outer lexical environment.
