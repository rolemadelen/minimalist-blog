The year 2023 in two sentences:  **"Career-wise, it was the most dreadful year I ever had. On a persnal level, it was the greatest year I ever had."**

For things I achieved in 2023, take a look at my [resume of success](./resume-of-success#h1-11).
And for the negatives, here's my [resume of failure](./resume-of-failure#h1-11).

# Japan → Life in Kentucky

- I left my job in Japan this February and came back to the States in mid-March. 
- After a long 3 years of distant relationship, finally reunited with my partner. And now you know why I said the year 2023 was the greatest.
- I enjoy taking walks with our cute dog, Cassie, the German Shepherd mix.
- We attempted to install the floor ourselves, and it went great.
- We consulted with a lawyer regarding a possible fraud issue we are facing with a house we own.
- I bought a shinobue, but I'm barely practicing \*sigh\*

# Career

- I was quite naive about finding a job in the U.S., welp, it was a huge mistake.
- Dealing with an overwhelming number of rejections ー not just rejections, but `No Responses`. While people discuss the difficulty of advancing past the first interview, I struggled to secure even the initial interview.

- Recognizing the urgency and my misjudgment, [I decided to make a portfolio](./i-decided-to-make-a-portfolio) because I never had one. However, this didn't help much. Maybe there's an issue with my resume? I updated it, but the outcome remained the same. I began questioning my experience and skills, **wondering if I'm simply not worth hiring**.
- Started learning new stacks and undertook side projects.
- Revamped my former [taiko team's website](https://asayake.vercel.app/) using Svelte.
- Updated the UI of my blog (the one you're currently viewing).
- Created my [second portfolio](https://www.jiieu.com/).
- Launched a [programming YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@rolemadelen) in Japanese.
- A very small contribution to [Adorable CSS](https://github.com/developer-1px/adorable-css/pull/76)

# 2024 Goal
- Dive into the study of UI/UX and Web Design.
  - Start by redesigning existing indie websites, at least once every two months, and implement them using React.
- Explore Animation and Interaction Design, such as GSAP and Framer. Also the 3D design using three.js
- Enhance proficiency in React and Next.js (Udemy)
- Complete two side projects:
  - Curated
  - Beat Maker but with Taiko
- Master playing [Shototsu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V6AayFe7v8) with Shinobue.
