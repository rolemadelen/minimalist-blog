I present to you my candid resume of failure, where I fearlessly embrace the lessons learned from setbacks and missed opportunities.

## ??

- After only one month of learning to play the drums, my parents bought me an expensive drum set that ended up as a decoration in our home.
- I bought a cheap electronic violin via Amazon, and again, it ended up as a decoration.

## 2011

- HS Cross Country (XC) - Unable to achieve the goal of running 3 miles in under 20 minutes.

## 2012

- HS XC - Continued efforts but still fell short of the goal, with a PR of 20:04 instead of breaking the 20-minute mark.
- HS Track & Field - Aspired to achieve sub-11.50 timing for 100m sprints, but couldn't quite reach the goal, achieving a PR of 11.88 instead.

## 2013

- HS Track & Field - Fell short of the goal to run the 100m dash in 11.00 flat, achieving an official PR of 11.48 instead.

## 2014

- I joined a community college's track & field team with enthusiasm, but gave up when I realized it didn't match the inclusive and supportive team I had imagined, facing discrimination in the process.
- I still worked as a team manager ◔_◔

## 2016

- UCSD - Not admitted to first-choice major, accepted with alternative major.

## 2018

- UCSD - Attended career fair, no successful outcomes.

## 2019

- Boston Career Forum 2019 - Interviewed with Apple but did not progress past the second interview.

## 2020

- Unsuccessful in the interview for a Ruby on Rails programming position.

## 2021

- Participated in a JavaScript study group, but unfortunately, the group's progress came to a halt due to everyone's busy schedules.
- Established a data structure & algorithm study group with five individuals, but our progress was limited to covering basic data structures before disbanding.

## 2022
 
- Organized early morning algorithm study sessions at the request of my friend, but unfortunately, the initiative faced poor attendance and ultimately ended in failure.

## 2023

- Submitted approximately 50 resumes as a front-end developer after returning from Japan, but encountered either no response or immediate rejections.
- Despite aiming to secure a job by June, my plans fell through just when I thought I had it within reach.
