# Note

> GPG Command Line Tools are not installed on macOS or Windows by default. To install it, visit [GnuPG's Download Page](https://www.gnupg.org/download/)

## Version check

Check the version of your `gpg` using `gpg --version`.

## Generating the key

If the version of your `gpg` is 2.1.17 or greater, use the following command:

```sh
$ gpg --full-generate-key
```

Otherwise, use this command to start the process.

```sh
$ gpg --default-new-key-algo rsa4096 --gen-key
```

### Select options and Verify

You will be prompted multiple times by the program. Choose the desired option each time and proceed, or simply press `Enter` to accept the default selection.

Once you have selected all the options, the program will list your selections for you to double-check. Verify the information, and if everything is correct, proceed, and the GPG key will be generated.

## List newly created GPG key

Use `gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long` to check the key you've just created.

```sh
$ gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long

sec   4096R/3AA5C34371567BD2 2016-03-10 [expires: 2017-03-10]
uid                          Hubot <hubot@example.com>
ssb   4096R/4BB6D45482678BE3 2016-03-10
```

Then if you want, you can use this command to export the GPG key in ASCII-armored format:

```sh
gpg --armor --export 3AA5C34371567BD2
```

You can then use the exported key for various purposes, including adding it to your accounts on platforms like GitHub.
