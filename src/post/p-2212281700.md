In November 2022, while still in Japan, I was busy packing, donating, selling, and discarding my belongings in preparation for my move back to the States.
During this time, I came across a [tweet](https://twitter.com/hmartapp/status/1444891624538996740?s=20) discussing the practicality and efficiency of coding in VR.

Gazing at my desk cluttered with 24 and 32-inch monitors[^a] and various unnecessary decorations, figurines, and extras, I realized I owned an excess of possessions.

Inspired by this person, I yearned for a minimalistic lifestyle with fewer belongings (this may not what this person was aiming for but anyway).

# Will VR coding really work?

I needed to be cautious. I didn't want to impulsively spend hundreds of dollars on a device and end up regretting it if it didn't work well for me.
So, I decided to conduct some research.

First and foremost, is it possible to read texts and code comfortably in VR? The text appears quite small in the images in the tweet.

[ùíΩùìÇ](https://twitter.com/hmartapp) confirms, "Yes, the text is easily readable."

# Is it going to hurt your eyes?

Next, I became curious about eye fatigue.
I wondered if prolonged use of a VR device would cause eye fatigue. This topic concerned me even more since I had recently undergone LASIK surgery and wanted to protect my eyesight.

Ah, pomodoro üçÖ technique makes sense.
I'm currently using the [Flow](https://flowapp.info/) pomodoro app, which helps me focus for 30 minutes and take a 5-minute break. How could I have overlooked such a simple solution?

ùíΩùìÇ also brings up the topic of neck support, which is reassuring considering how many people view the weight of the VR device as a drawback for extended VR work.

Fortunately, with the pomodoro timer, I can give both my eyes and neck regular breaks, which is fantastic.

# Is he still using it?

With all my questions answered, there was one final task remaining. I wanted to know if ùíΩùìÇ is still using the VR workspace, considering it has been around a year since the tweet was posted.
I reached out to ùíΩùìÇ through Twitter, and to my delight, received a response the following day.

He's still actively using it.

# Let's do it

After careful thought, I reached the conclusion that VR workspaces are worth exploring. Thus, I took action and placed an order for the [Meta Quest 2](https://www.meta.com/jp/en/quest/products/quest-2/) from Amazon.

I installed [_Immersed VR_](https://immersed.com/) and successfully connected it to my device.
Although it took some time to configure the monitor size, angles, and other settings to achieve the optimal fit for my eyes, I managed to do it.

I could read without any issues, and I didn't encounter any network-related challenges. I simply used my pocket WiFi[^b], and everything ran smoothly without any lag.
I'm truly content and satisfied with this setup. In fact, I regret not considering it sooner.

# Caveat

If you're considering setting up a VR workspace, I highly recommend trying VR first before making a purchase. While I personally didn't experience any discomfort, some individuals may feel dizzy or nauseated after using VR.
