You can sign your commits with a GPG key. Before we continue with generating a GPG key, let's first check if you already have one.

Use the following command to check for any existing GPG keys. This wont list `keyid`.

```shell
$ gpg --list-secret-keys
```

To list the `keyid`, you need to specify `--keyid-format=short | long` option.

```shell
$ gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long
```

The `short` format will list shorter version of `keyid` while `long` displays the whole ID.

Here's a sample of what the result might look like:

```shell
$ gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long

/Users/hubot/.gnupg/secring.gpg
------------------------------------
sec   4096R/3AA5C34371567BD2 2016-03-10 [expires: 2017-03-10]
uid                          Hubot <hubot@example.com>
ssb   4096R/4BB6D45482678BE3 2016-03-10
```

If you already have your key that can be used for GitHub, you may skip the next section. You might want to read _'Export the GPG key'_ part.

# Generate a new GPG key

> GPG Command Line Tools are not installed on macOS or Windows by default. To install it, visit [GnuPG's Download Page](https://www.gnupg.org/download/)

## Version check

Check the version of your `gpg` using `gpg --version`. 

## Generate the key

If the version of your `gpg` is 2.1.17 or greater, use the following command:
```shell
$ gpg --full-generate-key
```

Otherwise, use this command to start the process.
```shell
$ gpg --default-new-key-algo rsa4096 --gen-key
```

### Select options and Verify

You will be prompted multiple times by the program. Choose the desired option each time and proceed, or simply press `Enter` to accept the default selection.

Once you have selected all the options, the program will list your selections for you to double-check. Verify the information, and if everything is correct, proceed, and the GPG key will be generated.

## Export the GPG key

Use `gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long` to check the key you've just created.

```shell
$ gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long

/Users/hubot/.gnupg/secring.gpg
------------------------------------
sec   4096R/3AA5C34371567BD2 2016-03-10 [expires: 2017-03-10]
uid                          Hubot <hubot@example.com>
ssb   4096R/4BB6D45482678BE3 2016-03-10
```

Then, use this command to export the GPG key in ASCII-armored format:

```shell
$ gpg --armor --export 3AA5C34371567BD2
```

Copy the generated key and then go to your GitHub account settings.
Navigate to `SSH and GPG keys`, click `New GPG key`, and paste the key you just copied.

Now you are ready to sign your commits. In order to do that, you need to adjust couple configurations for the git.

# Signing a commit

You're going to need the `keyid` you just generated. 

```shell
$ gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long

# example
/Users/hubot/.gnupg/secring.gpg
------------------------------------
sec   4096R/3AA5C34371567BD2 2016-03-10 [expires: 2017-03-10]
uid                          Hubot <hubot@example.com>
ssb   4096R/4BB6D45482678BE3 2016-03-10
```

In this example, `3AA5C34371567BD2` is going to be the GPG key ID we need.

## Setup

Use the following command to set your primary GPG signing key in Git.
```shell
git config --global user.signingkey 3AA5C34371567BD2
```

If you are using a subkey (e.g. `4BB6D45482678BE3`), include `!` as a suffix.

```shell
git config --global user.signingkey 4BB6D45482678BE3!
```

## Sign off

Now you can use `-s` flag to sign off a commit.

```shell
git commit -s -m "commit message"
```

You can use `git log --show-signature` to check signed commits.

If you want to re-sign the most current commit, use the following command.
```shell
git commit --amend --no-edit -s
```

But if you want to make this a default behavior, set `commit.gpgsign` to `true`. Then you can omit the `-s` flag.

```shell
git config --global commit.gpgsign true

git commit -m "commit message"
```
