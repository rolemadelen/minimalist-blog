If you haven't yet, create a new SSH key in the `~/.ssh` folder.

Create the SSH configuration file in `~/.ssh`.

```shell
touch ~/.ssh/config
```

Add the new SSH key in your `config` file.

```text
Host github.com
   HostName github.com
   IdentitiesOnly yes
   UseKeychain yes
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Add SSH key to MacOS' keychain:

```shell
ssh-add --apple-use-keychain `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
```

Test the connection.

```shell
$ ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
$ ssh -T git@github.com

Hi rolemadelen! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

If you didn't, add the public key to GitHub Settings. This can be done via website or via GitHub CLI (`gh`).

```shell
gh ssh-key add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```
