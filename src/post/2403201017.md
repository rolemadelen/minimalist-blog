All of my notes are in one of these two main folders: `Capture` or `Slipbox`.

# Capture

The _capture_ folder is basically anything that has not been processed by myself. It could be a quick note that I took as I'm reading, listening, or watching something. It may be a code. I even have a note with simply a link to someone's article that I'm planning to read and take a note.

Here's a portion of what my current capture folder looks like.

# Slipbox

Now in the _slipbox_ folder, I put all of my processed notes here. What I mean by 'process' is that, these notes are written in my own words.

I actually lied, I have 2 more folders inside it: `Literature` and `Permanent`.

Let's say I took a note about _xyz_. If this idea/question was **posed by someone else** and I just processed it in my own words, it would fall under the _literature_ folder. 

On the other hand, if **i am the one who posed a question** and I'm answering it, it would go under the  _permanent_ folder.

For example, Let's say I'm reading an article about the 'miracle morning'. 
- (1) As I'm reading the article, I'd take a note inside the **capture** folder. 
- (2) After finish reading it, I would re-read my note and process it in my own words. This will go under the **literature** folder. 
- (3) While processing the note, 
    - (3-1) I got curious whether the night owls can get benefit from the miracle morning. I already had some thoughts about this, so I'd write this note in the **permanent** folder with a title like, "Anyone can get benefit from the miracle morning". 
    - (3-2) I had some thoughts about "the early bird". I'd create a note in the **permanent** folder and write my thoughts about the early bird.

# Map of content

I utilize map of content (MOC) to organize specifics of the note. This also helps me to visualize the notes in the graph view, because MOC will act as a gate or an entry to a topic that I want to read.

This is part of what my 'Git' MOC looks like.
