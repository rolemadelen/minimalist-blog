As I'm learning Rust, I decided to go for a project. But what should I make? Choosing what to make is always the hardest part when it comes to a side project. 

It didn't took long though. I decided to make a pomodoro timer. 

The reason for this is because, I started doing a study-with-me live on YouTube. As I do the live, I wanted to display a timer on the screen to share my state: `focused` and `on break`.

For example, here's the actual shot of me [doing the live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8VPYYqDY-Q&ab_channel=madelen) with a pomodoro timer I made.

## Planning Phase

I started by jotting down some of the basic features for this application. Here's my original note written in obsidian.

![](/images/2403221917/pomosh-screenshot-2.webp)


The initial name for the program was simply `terminal-pomodoro`; it's pretty mundane. I asked for ~~LLM~~'s help to generate some good name but meh ðŸ«¤

I decided to mix these two words: _Pomodoro_ and _Shell_. After trying some combinations, I decided to go with _Pomosh_[^1].

[^1]: I didn't know this but 'pomosh (Ð¿Ð¾Ð¼Ð¾Ñ‰ÑŒ)' means 'help' in Russian! ([toot](https://elk.zone/mastodon.social/@zenforyen/112136497291326282))

## Implementing Phase
### User input 

The input is straightforward. I prompt the user and get their inputs for the session and break durations in minutes.

Here's the initial version of the code before I refactored; it's only partial.

```rust
fn read_string() -> String {
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut input)
        .expect("[read_int()] failed to read an input");
    input
}

fn setup(focus_session: &mut i64, break_session: &mut i64) {
    let focus_bound = [5, 90];
    let break_bound = [2, 90];
    loop {
        print!(
            "How long is the focus session? ({lower}-{upper} minutes): ",
            lower = focus_bound[0],
            upper = focus_bound[1]
        );
        io::stdout().flush().unwrap();
        *focus_session = read_string()
            .trim()
            .parse()
            .expect("failed to parse a focus_session");

        if *focus_session >= 5 && *focus_session <= 90 {
            break;
        }
    }

	// ... break duration
}

fn main() {
	let mut focus_session: i64 = 0;
	let mut break_session: i64 = 0;
	
	setup(&mut focus_session, &mut break_session);
}
```

For pomodoro, it's quite unusual to have a session that lasts longer than 90 minutes. So I limited the duration to be between 5 and 90 minutes. 

### Display time

As you can see from the planning phase, I thought I had to get the current time to make the app get going but I didn't had to. I already know the duration, all I need to do is count it down from `x` minutes to `0`. The question is how. 

Rust comes with a native OS threads, so I can use `sleep`.

Since I'm displaying minutes only, I just need to decrement the minute in every 60 seconds of sleep.

```rust
let mut focus_min = 25;

while focus_min >= 0 {
	focus_min -= 1;
	
	println!("{}", focus_min);
	
	sleep(Duration::new(60, 0));
}
```

This will print minutes from `24` to `0`.

I want to display the time using ascii art. Thanks to [yuanqing](https://gist.github.com/yuanqing/ffa2244bd134f911d365), I was able to get all the numbers already defined in ascii format.

```text
000000
00  00
00  00
00  00
000000

1111
  11
  11
  11
111111

...

888888
88  88
888888
88  88
888888

999999
99  99
999999
    99
999999
```

The problem is that these numbers are all drawn one at a time. How should I print them side by side?

I first stored all of them in an array.
```rust
let ascii_art: [&str; 10] = [
	"000000\n00  00\n00  00\n00  00\n000000",
	"1111  \n  11  \n  11  \n  11  \n111111",
	"222222\n     2\n222222\n2     \n222222",
	"333333\n    33\n333333\n    33\n333333",
	"44  44\n44  44\n444444\n    44\n    44",
	"555555\n55    \n555555\n    55\n555555",
	"666666\n66    \n666666\n66  66\n666666",
	"777777\n    77\n    77\n    77\n    77",
	"888888\n88  88\n888888\n88  88\n888888",
	"999999\n99  99\n999999\n    99\n999999",
];
```

What I'm trying to do is..
- as I count down the duration (e.g. `24`),
- I'll separate the minutes: `2` and `4`,
- use it as an index: `ascii_art[2]` and `ascii_art[4]`,
- and read these strings line by line to print two numbers side by side

```rust
fn merge_and_print(a: &str, b: &str) {
    let a = a.to_string();
    let b = b.to_string();

    let a: Vec<&str> = a.split('\n').collect();
    let b: Vec<&str> = b.split('\n').collect();

    for i in 0..5 {
        print!("{}  {}", a[i].bright_blue(), b[i].bright_blue());
        println!();
    }
}
```

Now I get to print minutes like the following:

```text
 222222  44  44
      2  44  44
 222222  444444
 2           44
 222222      44
```

### Play the chime

I decided to play the audio when the session completes. I used the rust playback library, [rodio](https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio). 

```rust
use rodio::{Decoder, OutputStream, Sink};
use std::fs::File;

fn play_audio() {
	let file = File::open("./src/chime.mp3").unwrap();
    let source = Decoder::new(BufReader::new(cursor)).unwrap();
    let (_stream, stream_handle) = OutputStream::try_default().unwrap();
    let sink = Sink::try_new(&stream_handle).unwrap();

    sink.append(source);
    sink.sleep_until_end();
}
```

After the release, I had an [issue with the program not playing the audio](https://github.com/rolemadelen/pomosh/issues/3). This was because I used `File` to open the audio. I had to load the audio file at runtime. So I used `include_bytes!` to embed the file's contents into the binary.

```rust
const CHIME_SOUND: &[u8] = include_bytes!("../assets/chime.mp3");

fn play_audio() {
    let cursor = Cursor::new(CHIME_SOUND);
    let source = Decoder::new(BufReader::new(cursor)).unwrap();
    let (_stream, stream_handle) = OutputStream::try_default().unwrap();
    let sink = Sink::try_new(&stream_handle).unwrap();

    sink.append(source);
    sink.sleep_until_end();
}
```

## Reflection

I've learned numerous concepts while doing the project. Only couple days in learning Rust, I only knew about `std::io`. But through this project, I learned about other crates like `thread`, `chrono`, `SystemTime`, `rodio`, and many others.

Another new thing that I was able to achieve was letting people use homebrew to install this CLI program. I've never done this before, and I got very excited when I was able to install it using `brew tap rolemadelen/pomosh && brew install pomosh`. I felt like the old days when I was first exposed to the programming.
