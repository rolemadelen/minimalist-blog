Since August 12th, I've planned to engage in solving a LeetCode problem daily.
While I can't determine the exact duration I'll commit to, my initial target spans over a period of 30 days.

The levels of difficulty are visually represented by colored circles: 🟢 designates an _easy_ problem, 🟠 signifies a _medium_ one, and 🔴 denotes a _hard_ challenge.
