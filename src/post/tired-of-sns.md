I have to admit, it's become a bit of a habit for me to reach for my phone and check social media as soon as I wake up. Instagram, BlueSky, and Twitter (or X).

This morning, however, I had a little realization. I felt like spending so much time on these platforms wasn't really benefiting me. 
Especially with X, I've noticed an influx of negative content lately. Even though I don't follow those accounts, it somehow finds its way into my timeline, 
and I'm just tired of reading it all. So, I decided to take action and removed X and deactivated my account. 
The same goes for BlueSky, which I barely use; it seemed unnecessary to keep it on my phone.

But I'm not cutting myself off completely from social media. 
I'll still be keeping Instagram, as it's the place where I connect with my real-life friends.

With these changes, I'm looking forward to starting my mornings on a more positive note, focusing on the things that truly matter and surrounding myself with uplifting content and meaningful connections.

#### Update - August 10th, 2023

I noticed I was spending a lot of time on Instagram shorts and reels, so I made the choice to remove the app from my phone. However, I'm currently taking on a challenge for the month of August where I draw something new every day and share it on my account. For the purpose of posting my drawings, I'll reinstall the app temporarily and then promptly remove it afterward.
