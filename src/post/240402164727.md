_M3GAN_ (pronounced "Megan") stands for _Model 3 Generative Android_. It was created by the work-obsessed roboticist Gemma in the movie M3GAN. It is essentially a _toy_, a smart toy.

M3GAN is capable of walking, talking, singing, drawing, dancing, **thinking**, and even murdering.

In the movie, Gemma created M3GAN for her niece, Cady, who lost her parents from a car accident. M3GAN paired with Cady, registering her as the primary user. At first, it seemed M3GAN was doing great at taking care of Cady and even educating her. M3GAN started going over the line by killing the neighbor's dog that had bitten Cady and M3GAN, hurting and indirectly killing the bully at the camp, and even murdering people who were making Cady feel uncomfortable in the name of _protection_. At the end, M3GAN decided to make herself her own primary user because Cady was trying to stop her from hurting Gemma.

So, would you buy this _toy_?

If I remember correctly, the retail price for the M3GAN was going to be $10,000. Quite expensive for a _toy_, but it could be cheap if it can _replace_ your babysitters, caregivers, or even _parents_. And when I say parents, I'm not talking about existing, alive parents. I'm talking about situations like Cady where both her mom and dad passed away. In this case, M3GAN could be a great replacement.

Also, thinking about the harms of early aged exposure to digital devices, it could be much better to spend time with an android and actually talking and/or playing with it. The only concerning part is about it going over the line hurting people, uhm... Let's just wait for M4GAN.

Anyway, whether it's going to be M3GAN or M4GAN, I think it's worth buying it ãƒ¼ _just give up couple mac books._
