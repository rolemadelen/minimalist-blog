# Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is the simplest sorting algorithm which works by repeatedly comparing and swapping two adjacent elements if they're not in the correct order.


## How it works

Imagine you have an array -- `[3, 1, 5, 4]`  -- and your task it to sort them in ascending order.

The idea behind bubble sort is that we're comparing and swapping adjacent elements if the left element is larger than one on the right.

After the first iteration (first pass), we have located the largest element (`5`) and placed it on the correct position. After the 2nd iteration, we will have the 2nd largest element placed it its correct position. We repeat this process for `n-1` times in an array with size `n`.

As we compare adjacent elements, we can set a flag -- `swapped` -- to check if swap has occured. At the end of the iteration if the flag is not set -- `swapped = false` -- we can exit the process since all elements are in the correct order.

## Implementation

```rb
def bubble_sort(arr)
  n = arr.size
  for i in (0 ... n)
     a flag used to check if swap has occured
    isSwapped = false

    for j in (0 ... n - i - 1)
       swap if left is larger than the right
      if arr[j] > arr[j+1]
         set the flag
        isSwapped = true
        arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
      end
    end

     exit if the array is already sorted
    if isSwapped == false
      break
    end
  end

  arr
end
```

# Time Complexity

## Best Case
- number of comparisons: `n-1` times
- number of swaps: `0` times
- **T(n) = O(n)**

## Worst Case
- number of comparisons: (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1 = `n*(n-1)/2` times
- number of swaps: (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1 = `n*(n-1)/2` times
- **T(n) = O(n^2)**
