# The Issue

I was frustrated when I discovered that the top and bottom portions of my portfolio
were blocked by the iOS address bar on my iPhone XR. Surprisingly, it appeared perfectly
fine on my SE and 2nd Gen. iPad Air, but only on the iPhone XR did the status and address bar
overlapped and hid my name from my own portfolio.

# Solutions

## 1) CSS Media Queries

One quick solution to address this issue is by utilizing CSS media queries.
By targeting the specific device dimensions of the iPhone XR, I can make adjustments to
ensure the optimal display of my portfolio on this particular device.

```text
@media only screen
    and (device-width : 414px)
    and (device-height : 896px)
    and (-webkit-device-pixel-ratio : 2) {

    // set height
}
```

But this is not efficient. What if the same issue occurs on other iPhone devices as well?
Creating multiple media queries to cover every iOS device could result in bloated code
that lacks elegance. We value aesthetics in code, don't we (´･ω･`)?

Anyway, if you're using npm, you know npm is a vast ecosystem with numerous
packages to explore. I came across a particularly useful npm package called [react-div-100vh](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-div-100vh).

## 2) react-div-100vh

This package provides a straightforward solution for achieving a consistent 100vh layout across different devices.

By simply wrapping the elements in 100vh layout with `<Div100vh></Div100vh>`, this package
takes care of accurately calculating the correct height and ensures that your content is displayed
correctly on all devices. It's a convenient and efficient way to handle responsive layouts
without the need for manual adjustments or complex media queries.
