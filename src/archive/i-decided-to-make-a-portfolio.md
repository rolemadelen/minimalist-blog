I always thought my one-page resume with relevant work experiences, projects, and a link to my GitHub was enough to represent my skills. But I think it's time to think differently. Companies receive too many applications, and it's just not possible for them to read every bit of information in a resume or check links and GitHub profiles for every applicant. I need to stand out. I need to grab their attention. I need to make them want to know more about me.

My simplistic blog is not eye-catching. As for my GitHub, I believe it's well-organized, but it's nothing new. I'm sure HR or whoever is reviewing my resume has seen many GitHub profiles presented with great projects. So what's left? Nothing. I'm doomed ヽ(`д´；)/

At first, I thought it was my resume.
I spent days researching how to write a better resume that sets me apart from other candidates.
Then I came across this website by [Keita Yamada](https://p5aholic.me/).
It was a portfolio website. It's amazing how minimalistic the portfolio is,
yet it contains enough information to show who you are and the amazing things you can do.
I started looking up some portfolios, and they were full of
inspiration — [Lauren Waller](https://www.lauren-waller.com/) and [Lee Boa](http://leeboa.com/).

A good portfolio is what I need. Obviously, it won't magically get me a job,
but it's a great way to showcase my skills and demonstrate to employers how enthusiastic
I am as a front-end developer (_I hope_).

I'm still updating my portfolio based on the feedback I received from many great
people I asked to review it, but here it is, [my portfolio](https://rolemadelen.github.io)
website.
